## Languages and Tools

The system was developed using **JavaScript**, with **HTML** integrated through the **EJS** templating engine to generate dynamic pages. **CSS** was used to define the visual styling, enabling a responsive and adaptable user interface. This setup allowed the content to be dynamically rendered based on backend data.

To ensure better organization and scalability, the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern was adopted. The codebase was divided into three main components: **models**, which handle data logic; **controllers**, responsible for processing requests and responses; and **views**, which define the user interface. The **Express framework** was used on the backend in a straightforward way, enabling page routing and the handling of HTTP GET and POST requests for seamless navigation and interaction.
